The 'sumbin' package rolls together the basic functions needed
to compute the distribution of the sum of independent binomial
random variables, not necessarily identically distributed.

This is one of those computations that is analytically fairly 
straightforward.  It is just nice to have a completed set of functions
sometimes.

The usual functions for computing the density, distribution, quantiles,
and generating random variates are present.
